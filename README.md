# ChaseGame
3/24/18

Sloppy Python game I made on a Saturday. I've just been messing around with pygame and decided to see what I could make after a week of learning Python. That ended up in some dots that get in the way of a dot being chased by another dot. Now I'm just gonna periodically add stuff until it seems passable as something.

## Object Oriented Structure and Vectors

I kept the old chase.py file just as a reference, but I made a new file, chase_game.py, which has a much better structure and is more object oriented. There's a lot of extra stuff in the classes which will make it easier to add stuff in the future, but serves no purpose right now.
