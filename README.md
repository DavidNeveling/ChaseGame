# ChaseGame
Sloppy Python game I made on a Saturday. I've just been messing around with pygame and decided to see what I could make after a week of learning Python. That ended up in some dots that get in the way of a dot being chased by another dot. Now I'm just gonna periodically add stuff until it seems passable as something.
